Playlist Scrape and Play

What it is:

Playlist Scrape and Play (Playlist SNP) scrapes and plays complete YouTube playlists in VLC media player, commercial free. Also uniquely exports each videos URL, Title, Runtime, and Author into a well-organized Pandas DataFrame and from there, also out to a CSV file. Current version .84 is debug version. Simply plug a playlist URL into Jupyter Notebook and enjoy.
